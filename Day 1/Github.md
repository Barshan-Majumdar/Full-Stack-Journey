# 🚀 Day 1: Full Stack Journey - Git & GitHub

## 📅 Date: January 1, 2026
Today marks the beginning of my journey to becoming a Full Stack Developer. I focused on understanding how to track my code and collaborate with others using Version Control.

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

### 1. Git vs. GitHub
It's common to confuse the two, but here is how I'm distinguishing them:
* **Git:** A local tool (software) that manages the history of my code. It lives on my computer.
* **GitHub:** A cloud-based platform that hosts my Git repositories, allowing me to share code and collaborate.

### 2. Version Control System (VCS)
I learned that Git is a **Distributed Version Control System**. This means:
* Every developer has a full copy of the project history.
* I can "time travel" to previous versions of my code if I break something.
* It makes branching and merging features seamless.



### 3. Essential Git Commands
I practiced the "Big Four" commands that form the basic workflow:

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git init` | Initializes a new local Git repository. |
| `git add .` | Adds all changes to the **Staging Area**. |
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Saves a snapshot of the changes with a descriptive message. |
| `git push` | Sends my local commits to the remote repository on GitHub. |

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks Completed
- [x] Installed Git on my local machine.
- [x] Configured my username and email.
- [x] Created repository on GitHub.
- [x] Successfully pushed this `Github.md` file to the cloud.

## 💭 Reflections
The concept of the **Staging Area** (the middle ground between editing a file and committing it) was the most interesting part. It’s like a loading dock before the truck leaves for the warehouse.
